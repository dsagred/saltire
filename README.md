High-resolution cross-correllation fitting

*saltire* (Sebastian et al. 2022a, in prep.) is a simplistic model for high resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy (HRCCS) maps which are usually produced as by-product of atmospheric retrieval frameworks.

Furthermore, this model can also be used to derive masses of low mass stellar binaries (Sebastian et al. 2022b, in prep.).

Usecases for *saltire* are:

- Fit CCF maps to estimate the planets semi amplitude and systems restframe.
- Quickly predict the expected 'shape' of retrieval maps depending from the planets orbit and obsering phase.
