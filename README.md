### <img src="saltire_icon.jpg"  width="40" height="35"> A High-resolution Cross-correlation Model

*saltire* (Sebastian et al. 2022a, in prep.) is a simplistic model for high resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy (HRCCS) maps which are usually produced as by-product of atmospheric retrieval frameworks.

Furthermore, this model can also be used to derive masses of low mass stellar binaries (Sebastian et al. 2022b, in prep.).

Use cases for *saltire* are:

- Fit CCF maps to estimate the companions semi amplitude and systems restframe.
- Quickly predict the expected 'shape' of retrieval maps depending from the planets orbit and obsering phase.

**Development**:
- The current version supports weighting of observations i.e. to model a noise driven weighting usually applied during CCF map creation. This can also be used to model observations without or with minimised signal. 
- A physical phase curve model for inferior conjunction observations will be added in future.
